# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I just finished this Front-End Mentor coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, I used basics of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out given QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I was free to use any tools I wanted to complete the challenge. So I used semantic HTML and vanilla CSS.
